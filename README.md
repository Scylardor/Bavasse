# Bavasse

_bavasser_, verb [ intransitive ] : to chat (in French)

This is a simple app written in Python Tk that makes it easy to post on multiple social networks at the same time.

# Install

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Why?

I have accounts on X/Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky, Facebook... and sometimes I'd like to share the same message across multiple platforms.

I found no services that allow me to do this easily and without paying a subscription of some sort.

I decided to come up with my own, very bare-bones but functional solution.

# Supported social networks

- Mastodon (needs OAuth authentication)
- Bluesky (needs to create an App Password in your user settings)
